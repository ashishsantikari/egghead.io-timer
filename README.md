# egghead.io-timer

Problem Statement : Build a egg head timer which helps you cook eggs in a set time.

What am I aiming with this project : 

1) Write pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
2) Use some design patterns to simplyify code readability and implementation.
3) Understand separation of concerns(model-view-controller architecture).

## This project uses ES6 module system. Opening the file directly on browser won't work due to brower's restriction policy.
Please use a http-server (eg. live-server on nodejs)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server]) in the project root.
